Requirement: We have SN REST web service which is taking an XML file from Workday and populating a table with the content of its nodes. We have a separate LDAP import which is using a transform map to map fields from LDAP import set table to a New Hire table that will be used to trigger a series of tasks for payroll. However LDAP is not capturing the manager field for new hires. I created a business rule that when run will update the New Hire table with the addition manager field from the Workday API, thus allowing two sources to populate our table.
